# FrankenSX70_Arduino_Micro
Arduino code for "Franken"SX70 camera

+Disclaimer: first of all I want to say that I am not an expert coder in Arduino, or for that matter in
+anything, I am neither an expert in electronics. Come of it, I am probably not a good photographer.
+So please take all of this with caution.
+
+That being said, I want to explain what is Arduino and why I use it. From www.arduino.cc :
+	Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.
+
+	It's intended for anyone making interactive projects. Arduino senses the environment by receiving
+inputs from many sensors, and affects its surroundings by controlling lights, motors, and other
+actuators.
+	You can tell your Arduino what to do by writing code in the Arduino programming language and
+using the Arduino development environment.
+So Arduino is a way of controlling the physical world with a cheap board. I like Arduino because:
+
+It is very cheap, and popular, there are many many example to accomplish what you want, either
+with schematics, with code or both.
+There are many add-on boards called “shields” to accomplish almost anything you can think of.
+There are many libraries, that are sort of shortcut in code. That lets you accomplish complex tasks
+with simple code. There are also many many types or Arduino, or Arduino-compatible boards. You
+can even make your own.
+
+My idea is to install this boad externally and test it on a real camera, and then try to fit all of it
+(including a simplified-arduino) in the size of the original SX70 board to replace it. I know this has
+been accomplished, for example by the amazing MiNT SLR-670S. This is something else, more like
+an experimenters tool.
+I hope to have a decent enough code soon and publish it, and also an schematic.
